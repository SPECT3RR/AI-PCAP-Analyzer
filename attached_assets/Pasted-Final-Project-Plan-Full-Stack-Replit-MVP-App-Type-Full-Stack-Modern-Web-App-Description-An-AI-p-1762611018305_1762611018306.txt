Final Project Plan (Full-Stack Replit MVP)
App Type

Full-Stack Modern Web App

Description

An AI-powered PCAP analysis dashboard with a React glassmorphic interface and a FastAPI backend for real-time machine learning-based threat detection.
The platform provides interactive GeoIP visualization, IOC exploration, and automated PDF reporting — all within a sleek, dark, futuristic web interface.

At first glance, users are greeted with a dynamic landing page that explains:

What the platform does: automated AI analysis of PCAP network traffic.

Why it’s needed: to detect and visualize potential malicious patterns efficiently.

How it works: upload a PCAP → AI model processes it → dashboard reveals patterns and threat insights.

From there, the landing page transitions smoothly into the main dashboard environment, where users can upload their PCAP files and see interactive results in real time.

Core Features
🏠 Dynamic Landing Page

Visually animated landing page built with React + Framer Motion, featuring glassmorphic panels and neon hover animations.

Explains the platform’s workflow: Upload → Analyze → Visualize → Report.

Smooth “Start Analysis” button scrolls or transitions to the upload interface.

📤 Drag-and-Drop PCAP Upload

Animated upload panel with drag-and-drop or file-picker options.

Real-time progress and transition animations.

Once uploaded, file is sent to the FastAPI backend for parsing and AI analysis.

🧠 FastAPI Backend (/api/analyze)

Handles file uploads securely.

Parses PCAPs using PyShark or Scapy.

Runs your trained ML model (loaded with joblib) to classify traffic as benign or malicious.

Extracts IOCs (IPs, domains, ports) and returns structured JSON to the frontend.

🌐 Interactive Dashboard

Animated metric cards: packets, flows, unique IPs, malicious ratio, and predicted attack type.

Geo Map (React-Leaflet): shows per-IP markers with colors based on threat score; includes zoom and hover pop-ups.

Time-series charts (Plotly.js): visualize packet and flow trends, protocol ratios, and anomalies over time.

IOC Explorer Table: sortable and filterable, with color-coded threat badges (benign / suspicious / malicious).

🌍 Local GeoIP Lookup

Offline lookups via MaxMind GeoLite2 database.

Uses SQLite caching for high-speed repeated IP queries.

Displays country, city, and ASN on the map and in the table.

🧩 Threat Enrichment (Optional)

Integrate external CTI feeds (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, MISP, or OpenCTI).

Cache API results in SQLite to avoid rate limits.

📄 Professional PDF Report (/api/report)

Generates an elegant PDF using WeasyPrint with summarized findings:

Key statistics

Detected attack type

IOC overview

GeoIP distribution charts

Downloadable directly from the dashboard.

🧭 Responsive, Multi-Panel Layout

Kibana-style responsive grid with:

Top: metric cards

Middle: charts + Geo map

Bottom: IOC table

Adaptive design optimized for desktops and tablets.

Workflow Summary

User lands on a dynamic landing page with visuals and explanation.

Clicks “Start Analysis” → navigates to the PCAP upload panel.

Uploads a .pcap file → backend analyzes traffic with AI model.

Dashboard renders:

Charts, Geo map, and IOC table dynamically.

User optionally clicks “Generate Report” → backend returns PDF.

Expected Outcome

A sleek, glassmorphic AI dashboard that:

Detects and classifies malicious PCAP traffic.

Maps IP origins globally with color-coded threat indicators.

Provides interactive charts and detailed IOCs.

Lets users export professional PDF summaries.

Everything runs efficiently on a standard laptop and deploys seamlessly in Replit’s environment.
