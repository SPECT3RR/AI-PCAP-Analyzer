1. Change the App Type

From:

App type: Interactive data app (Streamlit)

To:

App type: Full-stack web application
Frontend: React + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion (modern animated UI)
Backend: FastAPI (Python) — handles PCAP parsing, AI model inference, GeoIP, and report generation

Why: Streamlit is for data demos; your app needs a dashboard-grade interface like Kibana with animations, multi-panels, and map interactivity — React fits perfectly.

🎨 2. Change the UI / Design stack

From:

Streamlit UI with file uploader and charts.

To:

Frontend: React (Vite) with TailwindCSS and Framer Motion animations.
UI will feature:

Dark, liquid glass theme (blurred translucent cards, neon cyan/purple highlights).

Responsive dashboard layout with metric cards, map, charts, and IOC table.

Animated transitions between views using Framer Motion.

“Download PDF Report” floating button using html2pdf.js.

Why: Streamlit’s components are static — you can’t do blur-glass panels, background motion, or neon hover effects.

⚙️ 3. Replace Streamlit backend logic

From:

PCAP file upload and ML-based analysis in Streamlit using pyshark.

To:

FastAPI backend (main.py)
Responsibilities:

/api/analyze: Receive PCAP file, extract flow/IP data (using PyShark or Scapy).

Run trained AI model (joblib/pickle).

Perform local GeoIP lookups (MaxMind GeoLite2).

Return JSON with summary, flows, IPs, and Geo data.

/api/report: Generate PDF report (WeasyPrint).

Why: Streamlit mixes UI and logic — FastAPI separates them and supports frontends like React easily.

🌍 4. Replace visualization tools

From:

Use Plotly choropleth maps and Streamlit charts.

To:

Frontend Visualizations:

Charts: Plotly.js (via react-plotly.js)

Map: React-Leaflet (with OpenStreetMap or Mapbox tiles)

Metrics: Custom React cards with dynamic counters

IOC Table: React DataTable with threat color badges

Why: Plotly.js + Leaflet in React give you full interactivity and better aesthetics than Streamlit widgets.

🔐 5. Threat Feed Integration (CTI)

Keep:

You can still use AbuseIPDB or VirusTotal in the backend (optional).
Change:

Move the API calls from Streamlit script into FastAPI service functions.

Cache responses in SQLite to avoid rate limit hits.

📊 6. Change the App Flow

From Streamlit flow:

Upload PCAP

Inline parsing and model execution in the same script

Charts rendered by Streamlit

Simple PDF with no styling

To new full-stack flow:

User uploads .pcap → React sends to /api/analyze.

FastAPI parses + analyzes + geolocates IPs → returns JSON.

React renders dashboard (charts + map + table) dynamically.

User optionally clicks “Generate Report” → calls /api/report and downloads styled PDF.

📁 7. Modify Folder Structure

From Streamlit single file (app.py)
To full project structure:

ai-pcap-dashboard/
├─ main.py                   # FastAPI backend
├─ model.pkl                 # trained AI model
├─ geoip/GeoLite2-City.mmdb  # Geo database
├─ uploads/
├─ frontend/
│  ├─ index.html
│  ├─ package.json
│  └─ src/
│      ├─ App.jsx
│      ├─ components/
│      │   ├─ UploadPanel.jsx
│      │   ├─ Dashboard.jsx
│      │   ├─ MapView.jsx
│      │   ├─ ChartsPanel.jsx
│      │   ├─ IOCExplorer.jsx
│      │   └─ ReportButton.jsx
│      └─ styles.css
├─ requirements.txt
└─ .replit


Why: Keeps logic modular and makes future upgrades (auth, database) easier.

🖥️ 8. Add .replit Configuration

Replace Streamlit runner:

run = "streamlit run app.py"


With:

run = "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000"


Optionally, if you want React to run inside Replit too, set a secondary run command for:

npm run dev --prefix frontend

📄 9. Update the feature list (keep AI focus but correct wording)

Your updated feature list should read like this:

Core Features

PCAP upload (via frontend drag & drop panel).

ML-based malicious traffic detection (FastAPI backend).

Interactive dashboard with charts, metrics, and maps (React frontend).

Real-time GeoIP mapping with IP markers.

IOC extraction (IPs, domains, ports) and threat scoring.

Optional CTI enrichment (VirusTotal / AbuseIPDB).

Downloadable PDF report (WeasyPrint).

Dark, glassmorphic UI with Framer Motion animations.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React + Tailwind + Framer Motion + Plotly + Leaflet

Backend: FastAPI + joblib + PyShark + MaxMind GeoIP

Report: WeasyPrint

Hosting: Replit (single project full-stack)
